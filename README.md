CONTENTS OF THE .PY FILES IN THIS FOLDER:

** graph.py **
a very simple directed graph class called Digraph

** dynamicDFS.py **
a dynamic iterative depth-first search algorithm for a directed graph
that returns all possible paths from one node to another.
    (This is much more complicated than the standard recursive algorithm,
but I wanted to see how it could be done - plus, it may be useful for
cases where recursion is undesirable.)

** treeBuilders.py **
two functions, one recursive and one iterative, each building a simple
directed graph with any user-specified number of nodes

NOTE: all code in Python 3
